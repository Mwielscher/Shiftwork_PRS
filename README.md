> **_Abstract:_**  Shift work has adverse health consequences, but the genetic basis of this vulnerability remains underexplored. Using Genomic structural equation modelling, we derived six latent sleep factors reflecting core RU-SATED domains from large-scale GWAS data. Polygenic scores for sleep regularity and daytime alertness showed strong genetic correlations with metabolic and behavioral traits and were causally linked to depression, well-being, and insulin regulation in Mendelian randomization. A phenome-wide association study in UK Biobank subset of night shift workers and controls (N = 46,211) revealed associations with T2D, hypertension, and COPD, and other outcomes, which were independently replicated in the All of Us cohort (N = 131,729). Incorporating behavioral traits into extended PRS improved predictive power. Stratified analyses showed that genetic risk for poor sleep regularity had the strongest differential effect, increasing T2D risk by over twofold in night shift workers compared to day workers. These findings highlight how genetically encoded sleep traits interact with environmental exposures to shape disease risk.
